{"name":"linal","tagline":"","body":"linal\r\n=====\r\n\r\nStructured SVMs applied to label sequence learning (the so-called HM-SVM) and\r\ngraph learning (or grid CRFs in particular). I am using\r\nthis code to carry out some experiments during my final degree project. A lot\r\nof inspiration has been drawn from [pystruct](http://github.com/amueller/pystruct)\r\nby Andreas Mueller for the grap learning part. The HM-SVM implementation in\r\nShogun I am using here is based on the matlab code by Gunnar Raetsch and Georg\r\nZeller [available at mloss](http://mloss.org/software/tags/hmsvm/). The code\r\nmakes use of [Shogun](http://shogun-toolbox.org)'s structured learning framework\r\n([+ info](http://iglesiashogun.wordpress.com/)).\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n============\r\n\r\nYou definetely need Shogun and SWIG. Also, you need to compile Shogun with\r\ndirectors enabled and at least target python's modular interface. In addition,\r\nwith the current state you need to compile Shogun with Mosek support. This\r\ndependency should be easy to remove though by using any of the bundle methods\r\nfor SSVMs present in Shogun.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of subgradient methods implemented in the graph directory.\r\nUsing this, you do not need Mosek any more. I have only tested them in the\r\ngraph learning task, but in principle they should work fine for label\r\nsequence learning as well.\r\n\r\nApart from Shogun dependencies, you need cvxopt for the linear programming\r\nrelaxation used to solve the argmax in graph learning.\r\n\r\nReport\r\n======\r\n\r\nYou can get a copy of my final degree project (PFC in Spanish) report here.\r\n[This version](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11020840/pfc/fjig_pfc_bw.pdf)\r\nis more appropriate for black & white printing\r\nsince the cross-links in the document are black.

I plan to prepare something similar\r\nin English soon for a workshop taking place in a few weeks. I will upload then\r\nthe source code as well.\r\n","google":"UA-42059931-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
